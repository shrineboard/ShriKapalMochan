                        <h4>Shri Kapal Mochan</h4>
                        <p>Kapal Mochan is an ancient place of pilgrimage for both Hindu and Sikhs, 17 km north-east of Jagadhari town, on the Bilaspur road in Yamuna nagar district. It is also called Gopal Mochan and Somsar Mochan. As per Legend, Brāhmanahatya i.e. killing of Brahmin is considered as a major sin, but one who kills a Brahmin and bath here, his Brāhmanahatya sins will be washed. </p><p>Nearby Bilaspur, Haryana (not to be confused with Bilaspur, Himachal Pradesh) in Yamuna Nagar District which takes its name from the corrupted form of "Vyas Puri", was the ashram of Ved Vyasa rishi where he wrote the Mahabharata on the banks of Sarasvati river near Adi Badri where Sarasvati river leaves Himalayas and enters the plains. 
It is one of the most ancient Vedic religious site in Haryana along with 48 kos parikrama of Kurukshetra and Dhosi Hill.
